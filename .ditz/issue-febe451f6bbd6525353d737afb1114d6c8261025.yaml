    actually it's a little more complicated than that, because the working directory doesn't
    get automatically updated when you push. so either sheila has to poll every once in a while,
    or it has to reset the working directory when differences are detected.
    
    probably the latter is the best approach because it doesn't incur any unnecessary network traffic.
