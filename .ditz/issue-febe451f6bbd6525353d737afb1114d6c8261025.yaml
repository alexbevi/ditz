    actually it's a little more complicated than that, because the working directory doesn't
    get automatically updated when you push. so either sheila has to poll every once in a while,
    or it has to reset the working directory when differences are detected.
    
    probably the latter is the best approach because it doesn't incur any unnecessary network traffic.

    it's possible to get conflicts (multiple people commenting on the same
    issue comes to mind), so it's going to have to be a manual process for
    now.
