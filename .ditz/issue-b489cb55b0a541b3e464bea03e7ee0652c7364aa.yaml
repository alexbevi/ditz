title: created and deleted events not in logs
desc: |-
  created events are easy enough---start logging them explicitly, or have
  special-purpose code in 'ditz log' to insert them based on event creation
  times.
  
  deleted events are harder, since right now they simply delete the file.
  options: don't log deletions, don't delete files, or put them in some
  other special object that isn't removed.
