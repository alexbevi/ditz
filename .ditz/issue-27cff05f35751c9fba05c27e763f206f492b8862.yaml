title: Store issues in .ditz directory by default
desc: |-
  A directory called "bugs" is rather ambiguous because:
  1. Not all Ditz issues are bugs.
  2. It does not indicate what tool created the issues.
  3. It isn't in keeping with the common convention of RCSs wherein 
  project metadata is stored in hidden .directories.
  
  Ditz should, IMHO, store issues in a .ditz directory by default.
