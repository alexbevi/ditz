title: Improve the 'ditz init' experience
desc: |-
  I decided to use ditz on one of my personal projects, but it fails and, 
  as a new user, leaves me a bit bewildered.
  
  i'm confused about how to enter initial components. Entering a single 
  word causes 'ditz add' to fail:
  
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/model-objects.rb:124:in 
  `validate!': undefined method `name' for "bookme":String (NoMethodError)
  
  	from /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/yaml.rb:143:in `map'
  
  	from 
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/model-objects.rb:124:in `each'
  
  	from 
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/model-objects.rb:124:in `map'
  
  	from 
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/model-objects.rb:124:in 
  `validate!'
  
  	from 
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/model-objects.rb:133:in `from'
  
  	from 
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/file-storage.rb:17:in `load'
  
  	from /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/bin/ditz:135
  
  	from /usr/local/bin/ditz:19:in `load'
  
  	from /usr/local/bin/ditz:19

  Perhaps nothing entered for a component should default it to a downcase 
  version of the project name? Either way, I'm not clear on what I should 
  enter here.

    ok, you're the second person to notice this and i can't figure out
    what's going on. can you try it with the ditz in git master?

    Now it works for me. I'll leave this issue open until the others who've 
    experienced it have a chance to chime in.
