    I'm not very familiar with yaml, but it seems like yaml requires that the text for the description field, for example, starts indented two characters in.
    
    So, if yaml requires that indentation, then that might not play nice with some of these markup systems that depend on being in the first character in the line.
    
    If this is true, what about storing the description text in a separate file, and in the yaml, just storing the path to that file?
