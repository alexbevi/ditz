title: Issue fields in UTF-8 encoding are stored in uneditable format
desc: |-
  Steps to reproduce
  ==================
  
  1.  Create an issue (via `ditz add`) with some nonASCII symbols put into any of its fields
  2.  Run `ditz edit <issue_id>`.
  
  Expected behavior:
  ==================
  
  All those fields are stored as I've typed them, to be readable and editable
  
  Actual behavior:
  ================
  
  Fields contain nonASCII chars are stored as `!binary` blobs (see issue {issue 422d53615d2d3a5318cf38f9c7837c6abb83cbc0})
  
  Notes
  =====
  
  I'd also suggest this issue should be addressed to upstream YAML implementation but I'm not sure, since I'm not using Ruby.
