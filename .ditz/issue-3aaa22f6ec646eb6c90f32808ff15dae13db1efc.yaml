title: issue-claiming plugin should compare email addresses only
desc: |-
  currently the issue-claiming plugin compares the full whoami string,
  e.g. "Bob Bobson <bob@bobson.com>". It should instead just compare the
  email address, because that's the actual unique and canonical identifier
  for a developer.
