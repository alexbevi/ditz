title: Show the results of ditz claimed and ditz mine in HTML
desc: |-
  This issue is really just a pretext to try out sheila.  Looks really neat!
  
  Anyhow, it might be nice when somebody claims an issue, if you could click on their name and then see all the other issues they claimed.
  
  Also, it would be neat to see "ditz claimed" as a report too.
