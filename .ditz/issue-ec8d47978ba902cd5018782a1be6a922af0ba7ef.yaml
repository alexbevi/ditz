title: make it easy to refer to other features
desc: |
  need some way of make this easy to do, and the end result should involve
  translating into feature name for text output and hyperlink for web output.
  example case: want to split an existing feature into two. so mark it as
  closed with disposition other (or something else?) and in the comment,
  mention the two features that you want.
  
  probably the best way is simple to parse the desc and comments for
  other feature names.
