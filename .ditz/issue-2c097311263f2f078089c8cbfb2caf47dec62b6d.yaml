title: sheila should auto-wrap descriptions when necessary
desc: |-
  descriptions are a little messy. sometimes they need to be wrapped and
  sometimes they're fixed-width things. sheila should ideally detect this
  and wrap as appropriate.
  
  (typically issues entered on the console are wrapped, and issues entered
  via sheila itself are not wrapped.)
