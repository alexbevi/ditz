title: Extract and abstract issue types.
desc: |-
  At the moment, issue types seem a bit inflexible. Here are a few 
  thoughts:
  
   * Move them into a plugin.
   * Move their definition into config files and provide a set of examples 
  to get you started. Configuration could include type name, how it is 
  rendered in changelogs/ditz internal displays, etc. This also paves the 
  way for new issue types--support requests entered from a web interface, 
  for example.
   * Make existing operators check for the plugin's presence, not 
  requiring it to be used.

    a good idea and worth some discussion. definitely not going to be
    part of 0.6 though.
