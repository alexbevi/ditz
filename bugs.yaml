      not critical for 0.1, and i want to get that out, and this will probably
      require another trollop release, so... this is deprioritized for now.

  title: extensibility
  desc: |-
    you should be able to extend ditz for things like tighter SCM integration.
    
    basic extension points: adding fields and model objects, changing the
    html and screen output accordingly, adding operations.
    
    use cases: integrate with git. integrate with a mailing list like sup-talk.
    
    currently {issue be0b8ee4588407615e2ba3acd0edeca08ed24df5} gives the ability to add field and model objects, and
    adding operations can be done by reopening Ditz::Operator. that's a starting
    point, at least.

      decided best approach is going to be sequential naming combined with
      strong validation. the merger/conflict resolver is going to have to
      deal with collisions. it's either this or git-style full hashes, and
      i think this is a better fit for the usage cases i imagine.

  title: make it easy to refer to other features
  desc: |
    need some way of make this easy to do, and the end result should involve
    translating into feature name for text output and hyperlink for web output.
    example case: want to split an existing feature into two. so mark it as
    closed with disposition other (or something else?) and in the comment,
    mention the two features that you want.
    
    probably the best way is simple to parse the desc and comments for
    other feature names.
