title: "support tiny issue identifiers (like #34) in the single-component case"
desc: |-
  If there's only one component, the issue names can be quite short. "#34"
  instead of "{issue bff58e50044e0827427fe5e4d1f0d3914b4ddc2b}" as an example.
  
  I would want to work in such a way that later adding a component automatically
  switches everything back to the traditional naming scheme.
  
  I don't think this would be terribly hard to do, since the names are computed
  on the fly. Should probably be enabled by a configuration option, though.
