title: add recent comments to commented section when composing a comment in $EDITOR
desc: |-
  as a follow-on to {issue b568fb686e59a42a727d143ad1367e93f8098352}, it would be nice to see recent comment
  history and maybe the project description when using your editor
  to compose a comment. these can just be thrown into the commented
  area.
