title: hook system
desc: |
  independent of {issue 0704dafe4aef96279364013aba177a0971d425cb}, which i envision as more of something that lets you
  add fields and operations, a hook system would be useful for performing
  commands automatically when pre-existing actions take place.
  
  examples: automatically add newly-created issue files to version control,
  automatically... something else.
