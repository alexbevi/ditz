title: store each issue in a separate file to avoid false conflicts
desc: |-
  the problem with one monolithic file is that two issues added
  at the same time still generate a conflict, because the SCM
  can't determine an order (even though it doesn't matter). having
  one file per issue avoids this entirely, as well as solving the
  case where issues are added in different orders (e.g. when issues
  are posted as mailing list patches and different repos add the
  patches in different orders).
