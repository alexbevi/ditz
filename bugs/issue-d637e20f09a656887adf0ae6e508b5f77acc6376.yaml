title: explicitly mark model object generators that require interaction as such
desc: |-
  some model object field generators and field default generators interact with
  the user. in order to make programmatic, non-interactive constructors work
  reasonably, this can't happen. the non-interactive constructor should instead
  throw an exception if it isn't supplied a value for this field.
  
  in order to do this, the constructor must know which generators are interactive
  and which are not.
