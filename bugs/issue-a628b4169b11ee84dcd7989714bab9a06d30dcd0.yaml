title: add more completion helper options
desc: |-
  In order for commandline completion (e.g. {issue d96a7a95dedc20072df13afa4515ee5d739229ce}, {issue bff58e50044e0827427fe5e4d1f0d3914b4ddc2b}) to work really
  well, we need options in ditz to list things like issues, open issues, assigned
  issues, releases, etc.
  
  Right now we have a --commands option which they use but that's it.
