title: support both per-project and per-user .ditz-plugin files
desc: |-
  Ditz should search for a ~/.ditz-plugins, and load it, and then should
  search for a project .ditz-plugins, and then load that. This allows for both
  per-project and per-user plugins to be loaded, with the latter overriding the
  former.
  
  Examples of per-user plugins include plugins that change or enhance the user
  interface, and examples of per-project plugins include plugins that integrate
  with a particular SCM.
