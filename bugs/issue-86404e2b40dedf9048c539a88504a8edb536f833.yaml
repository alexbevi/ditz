title: replace 'todo-full' with todo --all
desc: |-
  now that {issue 3d18eaab4e6099cd38f1cdee06698564e638e87d} is done, i'd like to have --all be the standard switch
  for all subcommands that typically operate on open issues, to instead
  operate on all issues.
  
  the todo-full command can be removed entirely once todo --all is working.
