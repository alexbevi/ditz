    decided best approach is going to be sequential naming combined with
    strong validation. the merger/conflict resolver is going to have to
    deal with collisions. it's either this or git-style full hashes, and
    i think this is a better fit for the usage cases i imagine.

  - nope, going to do git-style hashes and generate quick names at runtime
