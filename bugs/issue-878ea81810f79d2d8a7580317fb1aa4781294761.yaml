title: Improve the 'ditz init' experience
desc: |-
  I decided to use ditz on one of my personal projects, but it fails and, 
  as a new user, leaves me a bit bewildered.
  
  i'm confused about how to enter initial components. Entering a single 
  word causes 'ditz add' to fail:
  
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/model-objects.rb:124:in 
  `validate!': undefined method `name' for "bookme":String (NoMethodError)
  
  	from /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/yaml.rb:143:in `map'
  
  	from 
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/model-objects.rb:124:in `each'
  
  	from 
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/model-objects.rb:124:in `map'
  
  	from 
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/model-objects.rb:124:in 
  `validate!'
  
  	from 
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/model-objects.rb:133:in `from'
  
  	from 
  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/lib/ditz/file-storage.rb:17:in `load'
  
  	from /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/ditz-0.5/bin/ditz:135
  
  	from /usr/local/bin/ditz:19:in `load'
  
  	from /usr/local/bin/ditz:19

  Perhaps nothing entered for a component should default it to a downcase 
  version of the project name? Either way, I'm not clear on what I should 
  enter here.
