    When I run it with ruby 1.9 I see errors like this:
    
      /home/w/devel/ditz/lib/model-objects.rb:1:in `require': /home/w/devel/ditz/lib/model.rb:194: multiple assignment in conditional (SyntaxError)
      /home/w/devel/ditz/lib/model.rb:212: multiple assignment in conditional from /home/w/devel/ditz/lib/model-objects.rb:1:in `<top (required)>'
              from /home/w/devel/ditz/lib/ditz.rb:63:in `require'
              from /home/w/devel/ditz/lib/ditz.rb:63:in `<top (required)>'
              from bin/ditz:22:in `require'
              from bin/ditz:22:in `<main>'
    
    Which seems plumb crazy to me. Those are perfectly valid blocks of Ruby.
    
    As of now, I'm delaying fixing the Ruby 1.9 issue until I understand
    what the above is and whether I should care.
