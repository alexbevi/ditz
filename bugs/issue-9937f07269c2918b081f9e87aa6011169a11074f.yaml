title: rework hooks to handle both issues and projects
desc: |-
  current hook system is pretty biased towards issues, but the project filename itself
  has to change. {issue 26b420ae585ff1d2dcc34e8925593af45703699c} handles that but is kinda hacky. either the hook system
  needs to generalize to both objects, or needs to simply handle filenames.
  
  either way, this is an api change.
