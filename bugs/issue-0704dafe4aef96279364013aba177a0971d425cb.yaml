title: plugin architecture for tighter SCM integration, etc
desc: |-
  you should be able to extend ditz for things like tighter SCM integration.
  
  basic extension points: adding fields and model objects, changing the
  html and screen output accordingly, adding operations.
  
  use cases: integrate with git. integrate with a mailing list like sup-talk.
  
  currently {issue be0b8ee4588407615e2ba3acd0edeca08ed24df5} gives the ability to add field and model objects, and
  adding operations can be done by reopening Ditz::Operator. that's a starting
  point, at least.
