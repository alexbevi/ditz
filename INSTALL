There are a couple ways to install ditz.

1. If you have Rubygems, it's available as a gem. Command your computer
   to "gem install ditz".

2. Get the tarball. Since you're reading this file, you probably have it
   already.

  2a. If you're happy with ditz being installed in /usr/bin and the library
      files spread wantonly across your filesystem,
        ruby setup.rb
  
  2b. If you want to control where the files are installed,
        ruby setup.rb config --prefix=/bin /dir--siterubyver=/lib/dir
        ruby setup.rb install

  2c. Just run it directly from the tarball.
        ruby -Ilib bin/ditz

Good luck, and report any problems to ditz-talk@rubyforge.org
